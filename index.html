      <p class="card-text">Everyone has a story to tell, a lesson to teach, and wisdom to share... Life is a beautiful masterpiece bound together by your experiences. Open up and share your story; become an inspiration to others. You can make a difference because you matter. You were created with purpose. Live your life with intention, go out there and make a difference by being the difference.</p>

      <p>We often forget that we are nature. Nature is not something separate from us. So when we say that we have lost our connection to üåç nature, we‚Äôve lost our connection to ourselves.</p>
